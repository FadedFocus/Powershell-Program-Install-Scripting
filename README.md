Created a small script that does the following:

1. opening the run.bat file or invoking it in powershell ".\run.bat" (as long as you changed directories correctly "cd")
2. run.bat will run "download_installers.ps1" which will silently install programs and skip any programs already installed

Current set up:
Right now the script installs discord, I haven't thought about doing anything else yet
