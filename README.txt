Created a small script that does the following:

1. opening the run.bat file or invoking it in powershell ".\run.bat" (as long as you changed directories correctly "cd")
2. run.bat will run "download_installers.ps1" which will silently install programs and skip any programs already installed

Current installable apps:
Discord
Repl.it Desktop
Wireshark

Current Build:
ver. 3.9
wireshark is the 3rd app, and it took 9 fixes to be working correctly so 3.9 I dunno how else to name this.
